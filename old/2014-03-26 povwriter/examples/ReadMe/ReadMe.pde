/**

OK this is a trick to get you to read the instructions:-

You should run the installer sketch 1st, this installs the required
template files in a folder .povwriter2 in your home directory.
eg /home/tux on linux where you are tux or 'C:/Users/UserName' 
folder for most windows users. You should also set the path to
the povray executable using this sketch...

This library was built and tested on Linux, but the original 
povwriter libary was reported as working Windows 7 Home 
Premium, 64 bit. Please let me know how it works for you 
especially Mac users. Also it might be cool to share template 
files (how to do that?).
